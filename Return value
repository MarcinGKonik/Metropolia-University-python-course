""" Exercise description
The last exercise in this chapter extends the previous exercise, but it is also possible to make it completely independently. Modify the function tester so that, besides testing if the length of the given string is more than ten characters, it also tests if there is the character "X" (capital X) in the given string. If the string is longer than 10 characters and it has X in it, the tester subfunction returns a value True to the main function, otherwise False.

If the subfunction returns True to the main function, the program prints "X spotted!". As earlier, if the user inputs "quit", the program terminates. When working correctly, the program prints something like this:

>>> 
Write something (quit ends): Hello
Too short
Write something (quit ends): Ok a bit longer then?
Ok a bit longer then?
Write something (quit ends): Is Xavier here?
Is Xavier here?
X spotted!
Write something (quit ends): OMG
Too short
Write something (quit ends): quit
>>> 

Example output:

Write something (quit ends): Hi
Too short
Write something (quit ends): second test
second test
Write something (quit ends): XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
X spotted!
Write something (quit ends): Hi
Too short
Write something (quit ends): quit"""

#Solution

# Define the subfunction "tester"
def tester(givenstring):
    # Check if the string is longer than 10 characters and contains "X"
    if len(givenstring) >= 10 and "X" in givenstring:
        print(givenstring)  # Print the string here to match expected output
        return True
    else:
        if len(givenstring) < 10:
            print("Too short")
        else:
            print(givenstring)  # Ensure the string is printed even if not short and doesn't contain "X"
        return False

# Define the main function
def main():
    while True:
        user_input = input("Write something (quit ends): ")
        if user_input == "quit":
            break
        # Call the tester function. If it returns True, print "X spotted!".
        if tester(user_input):
            print("X spotted!")

# Ensure the main function is called when the script is executed directly
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
