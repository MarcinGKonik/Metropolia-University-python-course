""" Exercise description 
Unsurprisingly, the second exercise in this chapter discusses the task of writing to a file. Create a program which prompts the user for a file name "Give a file name: " and then for an input "Write something: ". After this, the program writes the string given by the user to the file and reports "Wrote [input] to the file [name].". When working correctly, the program prints something like this:

>>> 
Give a file name: log.txt
Write something: Attencion, attencion. 10, 10, 22, 33, Adios.
Wrote Attencion, attencion. 10, 10, 22, 33, Adios. to the file log.txt.
>>>  

Example output:

Give a file name: test.txt
Write something: This is test.
Wrote This is test.  to the file test.txt """

#Solution

# Prompt the user for a file name
file_name = input("Give a file name: ")

# Prompt the user for input to write to the file
user_input = input("Write something: ")

# Open the specified file in write mode
with open(file_name, "w") as file:
    # Write the user's input to the file
    file.write(user_input)

# Report the action to the user, ensuring to match the expected output format exactly
print(f"Wrote {user_input} to the file {file_name}")
