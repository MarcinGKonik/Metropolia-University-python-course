""" Exercise description

In this exercise the aim is to try out different datatypes. Start by defining two variables, and assign the first variable the float value 10.6411. The second variable gets a string "Stringline!" as a value.

Convert the first variable to an integer, and multiply the variable with the string by 2. After this, finalize the program to print out the results in the following way:

Integer conversion cannot do roundings: 10
Multiplying strings also causes trouble: Stringline!Stringline!   """

#Solution

# Define the variables with specified data types
variable1 = 10.6411
variable2 = "Stringline!"

# Convert the float to an integer
converted_variable1 = int(variable1)

# Multiply the string by 2
multiplied_variable2 = variable2 * 2

# Print out the results
print("Integer conversion cannot do roundings:", converted_variable1)
print("Multiplying strings also causes trouble:", multiplied_variable2)
