""" Exercise description
The third exercise is to create a conditional structure which prints a line depending on the given selection. The program asks a number between 1 and 3, and based on the number prints the following: 1 prints "You selected one.", 2 prints "You selected two." and 3 prints "You selected three.", like this:

Select a number (1-3): 1
You selected one.

Example output:

Select a number (1-3): 2
You selected two. """

#Solution
import sys  # Import the sys module for using sys.exit()

# Ask the user to select a number
number = int(input("Select a number (1-3):"))  # Convert input to integer

# Check the number and respond accordingly
if number == 1:
    print("You selected one.")
elif number == 2:
    print("You selected two.")
elif number == 3:
    print("You selected three.")
else:
    sys.exit()  # Exit the program if the input is not 1, 2, or 3
