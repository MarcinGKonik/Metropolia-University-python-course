""" Exercise description
The first exercise in this chapter consists of simple module library operations. In the chapter, a module called random was introduced. This module consists of several functions which can be used to get random numbers. The idea here is to create a program, which simulates coin flips by randomly selecting 0 (Tails) or 1 (Heads) and printing out the result. When working correctly, the program prints out something like this:

>>> 
Heads!

Obviously, as the program applies random activities, it may give any combination of five heads or tails. For example, running the program a second time resulted in this:

5 coin flips:
Tails!
Heads!
Heads!
Tails!
Heads!
>>> 

Example output:

5 coin flips:
Tails!
Tails!
Tails!
Tails!
Tails! """

#Solution

import random
import itertools

print("5 coin flips:")
for _ in itertools.repeat(None, 5):
    number = random.randint(0, 1)
    if number == 0:
        print("Tails!")
    else:
        print("Heads!")
