""" Exercise description

The last exercise of chapter 5 continues the exercise made in the previous chapter. In this exercise, expand the calculator so that the user can select what kind of calculation is done. If the user chooses 1, the calculator does addition as earlier. If 2, the calculator does substraction, if 3, it does multiplication, if 4, division.

Also add the instructions for the user to know what to do as shown in the example below. Also, if the user selects anything else besides 1-4, the program prints "Selection was not correct.". When working correctly, the progam looks like the following:

Calculator
Give the first number: 100
Give the second number: 25
(1) +
(2) -
(3) *
(4) /
Please select something (1-4): 3
The result is: 2500

If the user selects something else besides 1-4, it prints the following:

Calculator
Give the first number: 320
Give the second number: 225
(1) +
(2) -
(3) *
(4) /
Please select something (1-4): 100
Selection was not correct.

Errors such as the user giving input which is not a number, or division by 0, can be ignored at this point.
Example output:

Calculator
Give the first number: 1
Give the second number: 2
(1) +
(2) -
(3) *
(4) /
Please select something (1-4): 200
Selection was not correct.  """

#Solution

print("Calculator")

# Get the first and second numbers from the user
first_number = float(input("Give the first number: "))
second_number = float(input("Give the second number: "))

# Display operation choices to the user
print("(1) +")
print("(2) -")
print("(3) *")
print("(4) /")

# Prompt the user to make a selection
choice = input("Please select something (1-4): ")

# Function to format the result
def format_result(value, operation):
    if value.is_integer() and operation != '/':
        return int(value)  # Convert to int if result is a whole number
    else:
        return float(value)  # Ensure division results retain ".0" if they are integers

# Perform the operation based on the user's choice and print the result
if choice == '1':
    result = first_number + second_number
    print("The result is:", format_result(result, '+'))
elif choice == '2':
    result = first_number - second_number
    print("The result is:", format_result(result, '-'))
elif choice == '3':
    result = first_number * second_number
    print("The result is:", format_result(result, '*'))
elif choice == '4':
    if second_number != 0:
        result = first_number / second_number
        print("The result is:", format_result(result, '/'))
    else:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
else:
    print("Selection was not correct.")
