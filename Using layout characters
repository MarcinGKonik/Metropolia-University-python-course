""" Exercise desription

In this program the objective is to understand how the layout-characters (\t and \n} and print in general works. By using only the print command, make the interpreter to print out the following text:

>>> 

This here is divided to several lines:
I am still in the same print-command.
	Name:	Peter
	Job:	Babysitter
>>> 

With the first two lines it is possible to just use the line break. On the latter two tabulation is also needed.
Example output:

This here is divided to several lines:
I am still in the same print-command.
	Name:	Peter
	Job:	Babysitter   """

#Solution

print("This here is divided to several lines:\nI am still in the same print-command.\n\tName:\tPeter\n\tJob:\tBabysitter")
