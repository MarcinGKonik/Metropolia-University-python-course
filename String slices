""" Exercise description 
The last exercise in this chapter focuses on string slices. Define a variable and assign it a string "desserts" as a value. Then create three new variables, and assign them values by slicing the A) first 4 characters B) the last 4 characters and C) the entire string backwards as given values. Then make the program print the answers in the following way:

The first 4 characters were: dess
The last 4 characters were: erts
The string backwards was: stressed

Example output:

The first 4 characters were: dess
The last 4 characters were: erts
The string backwards was: stressed """

#Solution

# Assign the string to a variable
original_string = "desserts"

# Slice the first 4 characters
first_four = original_string[:4]

# Slice the last 4 characters
last_four = original_string[-4:]

# Reverse the entire string
string_backwards = original_string[::-1]

# Print the results
print("The first 4 characters were:", first_four)
print("The last 4 characters were:", last_four)
print("The string backwards was:", string_backwards)
