""" Exercise description
The exercise in the 9th chapter focuses on one of the most powerful tools in the Python language, the datatype list, and the first assignment is a simple exercise to create. Define a list which has four items, strings "Blue","Red","Yellow" and "Green". After this, make a slice from the list which contains only the first item of the list (list place 0), and print out all of the items with one for-structure. When the code works properly, the program prints the following:

			
>>> 
The first item in the list is: Blue
The entire list printed one item a time:
Blue
Red
Yellow
Green
>>> 

Example output:

The first item in the list is: Blue
The entire list printed one item a time:
Blue
Red
Yellow
Green """

#Solution
# Define the list with four items
colors = ["Blue", "Red", "Yellow", "Green"]

# Slice the first item of the list
first_item = colors[0]

# Print the first item
print(f"The first item in the list is: {first_item}")

# Print all items in the list, one at a time
print("The entire list printed one item a time:")
for color in colors:
    print(color)
