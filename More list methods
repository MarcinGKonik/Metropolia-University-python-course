""" Exercise description
The third exercise also revolves around list methods, this time doing data manipulation. In the same folder as the source code, there is a file named "words.txt", which has a randomly selected set of words. Build a program, which reads all of the words from the file, sorts them in alphabetic order and prints out the list with the statement "Words in an alphabetical order:". When correctly implemented, the program prints out the following:

		
>>> 
Words in an alphabetical order:
aardvark
beercase
buzz
hammer
house
lion
nail
roadworks
salesman
shovel
table
xenon
>>> 

All the words in the file are written in lowercase letters, and do not have any special characters or numbers.
Example output:

Words in an alphabetical order:
aardvark
beer
beercase
buzz
car
hammer
house
milk
nail
salesman
table """

#Solution

with open('words.txt', 'r') as file:
    words = file.read().splitlines()

# Sort the list of words
words.sort()

# Print the sorted list
print("Words in an alphabetical order:")
for word in words:
    print(word)
